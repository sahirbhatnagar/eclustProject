\title{Cross-validation for shim}
\usage{
cv.shim(x, y, main.effect.names, interaction.names, weights,
  lambda.beta = NULL, lambda.gamma = NULL, nlambda.gamma = 10,
  nlambda.beta = 10, nlambda = 100, parallel = TRUE,
  type.measure = c("mse"), nfolds = 10, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Design matrix of dimension \code{n x q}, where \code{n} is the
number of subjects and q is the total number of variables; each row is an
observation vector. This must include all main effects and interactions as
well, with column names corresponding to the names of the main effects
(e.g. \code{x1, x2, E}) and their interactions (e.g. \code{x1:E, x2:E}).
All columns should be scaled to have mean 0 and variance 1; this is done
internally by the \code{\link{shim}} function.}

\item{y}{response variable. For \code{family="gaussian"} should be a 1 column
matrix or numeric vector. For \code{family="binomial"}, if the response is
a vector it can be numeric with 0 for failure and 1 for success, or a
factor with the first level representing "failure" and the second level
representing "success". Alternatively, For binomial logistic regression,
the response can be a matrix where the first column is the number of
"successes" and the second column is the number of "failures".}

\item{main.effect.names}{character vector of main effects names. MUST be
ordered in the same way as the column names of \code{x}. e.g. if the column
names of \code{x} are \code{"x1","x2"} then \code{main.effect.names =
c("x1","x2")}}

\item{interaction.names}{character vector of interaction names. MUST be
separated by a colon (e.g. x1:x2), AND MUST be ordered in the same way as
the column names of \code{x}}

\item{weights}{observation weights. Can be total counts if responses are
proportion matrices. Default is 1 for each observation. Currently NOT
IMPLEMENTED}

\item{lambda.beta}{sequence of tuning parameters for the main effects. If
\code{NULL} (default), this function will automatically calculate a
sequence using the \code{\link{shim_once}} function which will be over a
grid of tuning parameters for gamma as well. If the user specifies a
sequence then this function will not automatically perform the serach over
a grid. You will need to create the grid yourself e.g. repeat the
lambda.gamma for each value of lambda.beta}

\item{lambda.gamma}{sequence of tuning parameters for the interaction
effects. Default is \code{NULL} which means this function will
automatically calculate a sequence of tuning paramters. See
\code{\link{shim_once}} for details on how this sequence is calculated.}

\item{nlambda.gamma}{number of tuning parameters for gamma. This needs to be
specified even for user defined inputs}

\item{nlambda.beta}{number of tuning parameters for beta. This needs to be
specified even for user defined inputs}

\item{nlambda}{total number of tuning parameters. If \code{lambda.beta =
NULL} and \code{lambda.gamma = NULL} then \code{nlambda} should be equal to
\code{nlambda.beta x nlambda.gamma}. This is important to specify
especially when a user defined sequence of tuning parameters is set.}

\item{parallel}{If \code{TRUE}, use parallel \code{foreach} to fit each fold.
Must register parallel before hand using the
\code{\link[doMC]{registerDoMC}} function from the \code{doMC} package. See
the example below for details.}

\item{type.measure}{loss to use for cross-validation. Currently only 1
option. The default is \code{type.measure="mse"}, which uses squared-error
for gaussian models}

\item{nfolds}{number of folds - default is 10. Although nfolds can be as
large as the sample size (leave-one-out CV), it is not recommended for
large datasets. Smallest value allowable is \code{nfolds=3}}
}
\description{
Does k-fold cross-validation for shim and determines the optimal
  pair of tuning parameters (\eqn{\lambda_\beta} and \eqn{\lambda_\gamma})
}
\details{
The function runs shim nfolds+1 times; the first to get the tuning
  parameter sequences, and then the remainder to compute the fit with each of
  the folds omitted. The error is accumulated, and the average error and
  standard deviation over the folds is computed. Note also that the results
  of cv.shim are random, since the folds are selected at random using the
  \code{\link{createfolds}} function. Users can reduce this randomness by
  running cv.shim many times, and averaging the error curves.
