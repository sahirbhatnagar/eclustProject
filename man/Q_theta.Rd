\title{Likelihood function}
\usage{
Q_theta(x, y, beta, gamma, weights, lambda.beta, lambda.gamma,
  main.effect.names, interaction.names)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Design matrix of dimension \code{n x q}, where \code{n} is the
number of subjects and q is the total number of variables; each row is an
observation vector. This must include all main effects and interactions as
well, with column names corresponding to the names of the main effects
(e.g. \code{x1, x2, E}) and their interactions (e.g. \code{x1:E, x2:E}).
All columns should be scaled to have mean 0 and variance 1; this is done
internally by the \code{\link{shim}} function.}

\item{y}{response variable (matrix form) of dimension \code{n x 1}}

\item{beta}{p x 1 matrix of main effect estimates}

\item{gamma}{p*(p-1)/2 x 1 matrix of gamma estimates}

\item{weights}{adaptive weights calculated by \code{ridge_weights} function
with rownames corresponding to column names of x}

\item{lambda.beta}{a single tuning parameter for main effects}

\item{lambda.gamma}{a single tuning parameter for gammas}

\item{main.effect.names}{character vector of main effects names}

\item{interaction.names}{character vector of interaction names. must be
separated by a colon (e.g. \code{x1:E})}
}
\value{
value of likelihood function
}
\description{
calculates likelihood function. Used to assess convergence of
  fitting algorithm. This corresponds to the Q(theta) function in the paper
}
\note{
you dont use the intercept in the calculation of the Q function
because its not being penalized
