Description: Eclust is a statistical method developped for identifying
    interactions between a high dimensional dataset and an environment variable.
    The method is comprised of two main steps: 1) dimension reduction based on
    the environment variable 2) model selection and estimation using a
    penalization model that imposes the strong heredity principle.
